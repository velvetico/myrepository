      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p class="p2">
        Velvet May is an italian and Berlin-based artist, live performer and DJ
        , focusing on Electronic Body Music, post-punk, industrial and Techno
        textures. The project was born in late 2018 and had his debut with “Vast
        As Black Night” EP released on his label “Tears On Waves” and that
        quickly received important supports from many artists of the scene. In
        June 2019 he releases his second and best-selling record "Unknown
        Bodies" whose homonymous track leaves a big mark and make his sound and
        textures better known. An erotic story based on touch, infernal gazes,
        yet divine that spread infamy and glory. A story of lost inhibitions and
        sensations. After couple of months, He defines his sound with his EP
        "Phoebe's White Skin", which appears as his most mature record in terms
        of sound that encompasses his project. The live performances full of
        energy, very organic and constant, put into action what is well built in
        the studio during the preparation of his tracks. Velvet May's music is
        represented by aspects such as lust, erotism and pleasure and he does it
        in the stark drama of his living mind. There a no simplifications,
        everything is translated without polishings and shades, but with respect
        to his real essence.
